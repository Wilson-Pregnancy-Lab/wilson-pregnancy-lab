-----------------------------------
*2023-11-23.* The lab has received a [SickKids-CIHR New Investigator Research Grant](https://www.sickkidsfoundation.com/aboutus/grantsandawards/newinvestigatorresearchgrants) to investigate tissue-specific DNA methylation profiles in cell-free DNA in association with preeclampsia.

*2023-11-16.* Sam will be giving a talk title "Non-invasive epigenomic methods and characterization of placental dysfunction" at the upcoming [Canadian Epigenetics, Environment, and Health Research Consortium Network Meeting](https://event.fourwaves.com/ceehrc2023/pages) in Banff, Canada.

*2023-10-16.* The lab's work was featured by McMaster as part of a new "Office Hours" series. Learn about the work in our lab [here](https://brighterworld.mcmaster.ca/articles/better-expectations-mcmaster-researcher-uses-ai-to-predict-pregnancy-complications/)

*2023-10-03.* The lab has received a SEED grant from the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society to investigate the impact of preimplantation genetic testing on subsequent placental development.

*2023-09-22.* The lab has received funding from the J.P Bickell Foundation to investigate changes in immune cell composition in preeclampsia!

*2023-09-18.* Welcome Melanie, Ananya, and Spring to the Lab! Melanie is joining us as our very first graduate student, and Ananya and Spring are starting their 4th year theses. Check out the [team](https://www.wilsonpregnancylab.com/people/) page for details about their research. 

*2023-08-24.* Keaton will be presenting at the September Canadian Placental Seminar Series. His talk will focus on his recent work assessing the effects of maternal cigarette smoking on the placenta.

*2023-05-16.* Sam will be presenting at the IFPA 2023 meeting, September 5th - 8th in Rotorua, New Zealand, as part of the Integrated approaches to detecting pregnancy pathologies workship. Her talk is titled "Second trimester cell-free placental DNA methylation profiles in preterm birth subtypes."

*2023-05-01.* Welcome to the new Wilson Pregnancy Lab members! Keaton and Simon will be joining the lab as coop students, and Natalie will be continuing in the lab as a coop student. Laiba will be joining the lab for the summer to gain computational skills for her indpendent learning course. Check out the team page to learn more about their projects.

*2023-04-14.* Congratulations to Mehroop for winning best thesis presentation in her session at the Biology Undergraduate Research Day!

*2023-04-13.* Ahmed and Mehroop present their fourth year theses at the Biochemistry Undergraduate Research Day and Biology Research Day, respectfully.

*2023-03-24.* Sam will be a speaker at the Society of Birth Defects Research and Prevention Meeting that will be in Charleston, SC, USA, June 24 - 28th, 2023. Her talk is titled "Epigenomic Techniques and Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Pregnancy Complications."

*2023-03-23.* Sam is co-author on a paper titled ["Characterization of methylation profiles in spontaneous preterm birth placental villous tissue"](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0279991)
