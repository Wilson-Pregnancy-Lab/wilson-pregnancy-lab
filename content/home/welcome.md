The **Wilson Lab** is located at McMaster University within the Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

We are an all things 'omics research group with an emphasis on genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. Our goal is to develop non-invasive methods to predict pregnancy complications before they occur, and to understand the cause of placental dysfunction. We work in the fields of genomics, computational biology, and reproduction.
