The **Wilson Lab** is located at [McMaster University,](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) within the [Faculty of Health Sciences](https://healthsci.mcmaster.ca/), [Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology](https://obsgyn.mcmaster.ca/home).

We are an all things 'omics research group with an emphasis on genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. Our goal is to develop non-invasive methods to predict pregnancy complications before they occur, and to understand the cause of placental dysfunction. We work in the fields of genomics, computational biology, and reproduction.
