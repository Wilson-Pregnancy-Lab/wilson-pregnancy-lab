I am a 4th Year student studying Biochemistry at McMaster University. I am working at the Wilson lab as a thesis student. Using computational methods my project examines DNA methylation and immune cell type proportion in pre-eclamptic pregnancies. In my free time I enjoy playing sports and doing photography.
