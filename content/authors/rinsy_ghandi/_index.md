Rinsy is a third-year student in the Biochemistry program at McMaster. Her third-year research project investigates patterns of cell-free DNA fragmentation in the context of pregnancy. Her project involves analyzing fragment end motifs in cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing data from healthy pregnancies and those resulting in preterm birth. With a strong interest in women’s health, Rinsy is eager to enhance her computational skills in the lab. In her free time, she enjoys baking desserts, reading books, and watching Formula 1.
