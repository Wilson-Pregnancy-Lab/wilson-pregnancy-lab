Kriesha is a fourth-year undergraduate thesis student in the Biochemistry Co-op program at McMaster University. Her project investigates how genomic and epigenetic factors related to lipid metabolism differ between those with preeclampsia or female infertility and the general population. With her passion for women's health, Kriesha is excited to explore the world of bioinformatics and contribute to existing knowledge in the field. Outside the lab, Kriesha loves to “read” audiobooks, learn ballet and spend time with her family.
