Ananya is a Fourth-year student at McMaster University in the program Biomedical Discovery and Commercialization. With a passion for pathology, epigenetics, and the application of computation in healthcare, Ananya is excited to embark on her thesis journey. Her Undergraduate thesis will explore the sex-specific differences in cell-free placental DNA in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies. When sheâ€™s not hunched over a laptop, or holding a pipette, Ananya enjoys going on sunset runs, reading everything she can get her hands on, and listening to her innumerable Spotify playlists.
