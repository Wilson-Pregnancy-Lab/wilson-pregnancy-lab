## **Graduate Students**

Prospective students should be accepted to MSc, PhD, or MD/PhD programs in:

> 1. [Medical Sciences](https://gs.mcmaster.ca/program/medical-sciences/)
> 2. [Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences](https://gs.mcmaster.ca/program/biochemistry-and-biomedical-sciences/)

I am looking for prospective students with a strong background in genetics, with at least basic experience in computational biology.
Experience in a unix environment, high performance computing, and scripting in R, Python and/or bash are assets. 

To apply to a graduate student position within the Wilson Pregnancy Lab, please email a copy of your CV (PDF format), a cover letter explaining your research interests, contact information for 3 references, and transcripts to wilsos66[at]mcmaster.ca with the subject line "[MSc or PhD] Application: [Your Name]". For example, MSc Application: Jane Doe.

#### *Funding*

Any accepted student will be awarded the minimum funding package in accordance with their graduate student program. 

## **Undergraduate Students**

### *Senior thesis students*
We are open to senior undergraduate thesis students. To apply, please email a copy of your CV (PDF format), a cover letter explaining your research interests, contact information for 3 references, and transcripts to wilsos66[at]mcmaster.ca with the subject line "[UNDERGRAD THESIS] Application: [Your Name]" (E.g. 4th year thesis: John Doe). Priority will be given to students who have taken BIOCHEM 3BP3 or similar.

### *Summer work experience*
We are open to undergraduate summer students. To apply, please email a copy of your CV (PDF format), a cover letter explaining your research interests, contact information for 3 references, and transcripts to wilsos66[at]mcmaster.ca with the subject line "[UNDERGRAD SUMMER] Application: [Your Name]".

## **Postdoctoral Fellows**

Scientists that are within a year of completing their PhD with experience in high dimensional data, bioinformatics, machine learning, 'omics (e.g. genomics, epigenomics, transciptomics) with an interest in pregnancy and placental development are encouraged to apply. *Currently we do not have funding for postdoctoral fellows, however, we welcome applications from scientists who have aquired independent funding*

To apply to a postdoctoral position within the Wilson Pregnancy Lab, please email a copy of your CV (PDF format), a cover letter explaining your research interests, one paper representative of your work and research interests (PDF format), contact information for 3 references, and a URL to a web page containing a sample of code written by you (e.g. Github or Bitbucket) to wilsos66[at]mcmaster.ca with the subject line "POSTDOC Application: [Your Name]".


## **Technicians and Research Assistants**
We are not currently seeking technicians and research assistants.


## **Lab and Training Environment**
I am dedicated to providing a safe, welcoming and inclusive research environment. Attracting talented trainees and helping them to reach their careers goals (academic or not) is key component to scientific research and its future. The goal of my lab is to train the next generation of scientists to be responsible scientists; this includes, being inclusive and collaborative, ethical, and strive for reproducible research. I am looking for members of my lab to also hold these values. 

I try to limit the number of trainees I take on to 1-2 per year. This is to ensure I am able to commit enought time, and be available for all my trainees.
