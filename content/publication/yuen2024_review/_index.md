Abstract: Cell-free placental DNA (cfpDNA) is present in maternal circulation during gestation. CfpDNA carries great potential as a research and clinical tool as it provides a means to investigate the placental (epi)genome across gestation, which previously required invasive placenta sampling procedures. CfpDNA has been widely implemented in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Despite this, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting the research and clinical utility of cfpDNA. This review will examine the current knowledge of cfpDNA, including origins and molecular characteristics, highlight gaps in knowledge, and discuss future research directions.
